-tailwind docs : ctrl + alt + t
-We need tailwind typography because html markdown that is fetched from backend, fonts can not be applied to it through normal tailwind.
-If you want to create a folder in app directory and not have a route on it, put () around it.
-[] means dynamic route
-loading,page,layout etc are keywords
-rfce makes function of component name. tsrfce does the same in typescript style
-You can now have different metadata and icons for different pages
-Relative on parent component, absolute on child component.
-npx init primsa
-Configure database url and set up database
-Create Prisma schema
- npx primsa db push
- npx prisma studio shows you posts in localhost
- Next JS Images : Smaller images automatically on smaller screens for faster loading and less memory and processing.
- First way to set dimensions of image is height and fidth.
- The other way is to set fill wnere then image goes relatie to container. SO  make sure container has relative property and is responsive. (w-full and h-full)
- Then sou can set style and choose the appropriate objectFit
-If we use post.image directly it is impossible to add placeholder property. So we have to format images and make them static imports
- If we are fetching from a url we have 3 options. cache:force-cache makes it static, cahce: no-store makes the fetch server side, and next : {revalidate : 60} makes it ISR.
- If you are fetching from a source where fetch func is not needed, e.g prisma client then we can put revalidation by just writing export const revalidate = 60 for revalidation after every 60s
- Any kind of interaction means use client components. (state changes etc)
-We have to align our editor to the state.
